#   Version 8.0
#   HISTORY
#   2012.4.18 Add gensym.py support
#   2012.4.20 Add fft2mg_mode and fft2mg_interp
#   2012.4.22 Add [Algorithm] section
#   2012.4.24 Add dielectric_constant, charge_distribution to [Algorithm].
#             Delete isAnnealed from [Model].
#   2012.10.10 Break compatability with previous version. Only for scftpy use. Move Ms from [Model] to [Grid].
#   2012.10.11 Currently, only supports one type of chain.
#   2012.11.08 Add BC support.
#   2013.06.24 Add q_file.
#   2013.07.31 Compatible with scftpy/bulk.
#   2014.06.12 Compatible with current version of Polyorder
#   NOTES
#   1. Commends can be added as a "#"-leading-line.
#   2. Key and value should be comparted by a equal sign, and all blank character between keys and values will be neglected automatically.
#   2.1 The trailing whitespaces may cause serious problem, they should be removed carefully. (Note added by Yi-Xin Liu)
#   2.2 Support section name. Section name is enclosed by square bracket.
#   3. No difference will be caused by changing the suquences of the parameters.
#   4. The version of this file (param.ini) should be the same as the version of the script paramx.
#   5. BC vector is [a,b,c] where
#               a du/dx + b u = c
#   6. Enjoy.
